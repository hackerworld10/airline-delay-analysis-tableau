Airline delay analysis using SQL and Tableau dashboards

# Airline Delay Analysis (Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview
Flight delays impact passenger experience, airline operations, and airport efficiency.
This project analyzes historical airline delay data to evaluate airport reliability,
identify seasonal delay trends, and understand the primary causes of delays using
interactive Tableau dashboards.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Rank airports based on on-time performance
- Identify seasonal and monthly delay patterns
- Analyze major causes of flight delays
- Provide insights for improving operational reliability

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- **Airport Reliability Ranking**
  - Compared airports using on-time arrival percentage
- **Seasonal Delay Trends**
  - Analyzed delay patterns across months and years
- **Delay Cause Analysis**
  - Evaluated impact of weather, carrier, NAS, security, and late aircraft delays
- **Performance Comparison**
  - Identified consistently high- and low-performing airports

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Morning flights generally have a lower probability of delay
- Weather-related delays increase significantly during monsoon months
- Certain hub airports consistently perform better despite higher traffic volume
- Late aircraft and carrier delays contribute most to total delays

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards and visual analytics
